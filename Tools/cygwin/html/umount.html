>Cygwin comes with a number of command-line utilities that are
used to manage the UNIX emulation portion of the Cygwin environment.
While many of these reflect their UNIX counterparts, each was written
specifically for Cygwin.</P

>Usage umount [-s] &#60;posixpath&#62;
-s = remove mount point from system-wide registry location

--remove-all-mounts = remove all mounts
--remove-auto-mounts = remove all automatically mounted mounts
--remove-user-mounts = remove all mounts in the current user mount registry area, including auto mounts
--remove-system-mounts = Remove all mounts in the system-wide mount registry area</PRE

>The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>umount</B
> program removes mounts from the
mount table.  If you specify a POSIX path that corresponds to a
current mount point, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>umount</B
> will remove it from the
user-specific registry area.  The -s flag may be used to specify
removing the mount from the system-wide registry area instead
(Administrator priviledges are required).</P
><P
>The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>umount</B
> utility may also be used to remove
all mounts of a particular type.  With the extended options it is
possible to remove all mounts, all automatically-mounted mounts, all
mounts in the current user's registry area, or all mounts in the
system-wide registry area (with Administrator priviledges).</P
