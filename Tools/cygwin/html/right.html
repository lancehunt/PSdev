<DT><I>What is Cygwin?</I>
<DD>According to the <A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin website</A>, 
<TT>"The Cygwin tools are ports of the popular GNU development tools and 
      utilities for Windows 95, 98, and NT. They function by using the Cygwin 
      library which provides a UNIX-like API on top of the Win32 API. <A 
      href="http://www.cygwin.com/faq/faq_1.html">More info...</A>" 
</TT>

<DT><BR><I>What is Cygwin-Lite?</I>
<DD>
Cygwin-lite is a subset of the Cygwin tools. The self-executing setup
file is designed to fit on a 1.44MB 
floppy disk, and thus to overcome the main limitation of the Cygwin 
environment---its size (my current installation is around 80MB). 

<DT><BR><I>Which tools exactly are included?</I>
<DD>
If you've installed Cygwin-Lite, all the ones listed in the HTML index.
If not, and you're 
wondering about <TT> find, gzip, grep, less, tar, </TT>or<TT> vim,</TT> they're
all there.

<DT><BR><I>Why bother?</I>
<DD>
I began to look into a smaller installation when working on 
computer-lab Windows machines from only a small amount of network space 
(about 5MB). Batch files simply weren't effective, and <TT>more </TT> 
isn't <TT> less</TT>. 
I discovered that most of my favorite Cygwin tools took up only a small 
amount 
of disk space, but since the Cygwin <TT>setup.exe</TT> uses "packages" it
lacked the versatility to perform a minimal install. 
I also see applications for dial-up bound Windows users who want a 
*nix shell.

<DT><BR><I>How do Cygwin and Cgywin-Lite interact on the same computer?</I>
<DD>
Cygwin-Lite is really just a type of Cygwin installation. All the files
in Cygwin-Lite are present in a complete Cygwin install, except the
scripts in <TT> /src</TT> and the HTML man pages in <TT> /html.</TT> 
Unfortunately, since <TT>cygwin1.dll</TT> makes use of the Windows registry 
for its mount table, no two Cygwin installations (including 
Cygwin-Lite) can coexist on the same system. However, Cygwin-Lite
installs to the directory <TT>C:\Program Files\cygwin </TT> by default 
to avoid any file loss if both are installed.

<DT><BR><I>Why does your installer look like WinAmp?</I>
<DD>
Nullsoft, the makers of WinAmp, created a Free installer called 
<A HREF="http://www.nullsoft.com/free/">NSIS</A>
(Nullsoft Superpimp Installation System). I used it because it is also
small and flexible. The <TT>makensis.exe </TT> utility from
NSIS is required for building your own self-executable based on 
Cygwin-Lite.

<DT><BR><I>Where's the source code?</I>
<DD>
The only "source code" for Cygwin-Lite is a few install scripts and the
bitmaps used by the self-executable. They can be found in the <TT>/src </TT> 
directory after installing.

Since the main goal of this project is small size, I have not collected
sources from the individual projects (Cygwin, NSIS). Contact me if you
have trouble finding them.
