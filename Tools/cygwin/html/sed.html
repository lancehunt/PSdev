<H2>NAME</H2>

sed - a Stream EDitor
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<PRE>
sed [-n] [-V] [--quiet] [--silent] [--version] [--help]
    [-e script] [--expression=script]
    [-f script-file] [--file=script-file]
    [script-if-no-other-script]
    [file...]
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I>Sed</I> is a stream editor.
A stream editor is used to perform basic text
transformations on an input stream
(a file or input from a pipeline).
While in some ways similar to an editor which
permits scripted edits (such as <I>ed</I>),
<I>sed</I> works by making only one pass over the
input(s), and is consequently more efficient.
But it is <I>sed</I>'s ability to filter text in a pipeline
which particularly distinguishes it from other types of
editors.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<I>Sed</I> may be invoked with the following command-line options:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-V</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>--version</B>

<DD>
Print out the version of sed that is being run and a copyright notice,
then exit.
<DT><B>-h</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>--help</B>

<DD>
Print a usage message briefly summarizing these command-line options
and the bug-reporting address,
then exit.
<DT><B>-n</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>--quiet</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>--silent</B>

<DD>
By default, <I>sed</I> will print out the pattern space
at the end of each cycle through the script.
These options disable this automatic printing,
and <I>sed</I> will only produce output when explicitly told to
via the
<B>p</B>

command.
<DT><B>-e </B><I>script</I>

<DD>
<DT><B>--expression=</B><I>script</I>

<DD>
Add the commands in
<I>script</I>

to the set of commands to be run while processing the input.
<DT><B>-f </B><I>script-file</I>

<DD>
<DT><B>--file=</B><I>script-file</I>

<DD>
Add the commands contained in the file
<I>script-file</I>

to the set of commands to be run while processing the input.
</DL>
<P>

If no
<B>-e</B>,<B>-f</B>,<B>--expression</B>,

or
<B>--file</B>

options are given on the command-line,
then the first non-option argument on the command line is
taken to be the
<I>script</I>

to be executed.
<P>

If any command-line parameters remain after processing the above,
these parameters are interpreted as the names of input files to
be processed.
A file name of
<B>-</B>

refers to the standard input stream.
The standard input will processed if no file names are specified.

<H2>Command Synopsis</H2>

This is just a brief synopsis of <I>sed</I> commands to serve as
a reminder to those who already know sed;
other documentation (such as the texinfo document)
must be consulted for fuller descriptions.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Zero-address ``commands''</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>:&nbsp;<I>label</I>

<DD>
Label for
<B>b</B>

and
<B>t</B>

commands.
<DT>#<I>comment</I>

<DD>
The comment extends until the next newline (or the end of a
<B>-e</B>

script fragment).
<DT>}<DD>
The closing bracket of a { } block.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Zero- or One- address commands</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>=<DD>
Print the current line number.
<DT>a \<DD>
<DT><I>text</I>

<DD>
Append
<I>text</I>,

which has each embedded newline preceeded by a backslash.
<DT>i \<DD>
<DT><I>text</I>

<DD>
Insert
<I>text</I>,

which has each embedded newline preceeded by a backslash.
<DT>q<DD>
Immediately quit the <I>sed</I> script without processing
any more input,
except that if auto-print is not diabled
the current pattern space will be printed.
<DT>r&nbsp;<I>filename</I>

<DD>
Append text read from
<I>filename</I>.

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Commands which accept address ranges</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>{<DD>
Begin a block of commands (end with a }).
<DT>b&nbsp;<I>label</I>

<DD>
Branch to
<I>label</I>;

if
<I>label</I>

is omitted, branch to end of script.
<DT>t&nbsp;<I>label</I>

<DD>
If a s/// has done a successful substitution since the
last input line was read and since the last t command,
then branch to
<I>label</I>;

if
<I>label</I>

is omitted, branch to end of script.
<DT>c \<DD>
<DT><I>text</I>

<DD>
Replace the selected lines with
<I>text</I>,

which has each embedded newline preceeded by a backslash.
<DT>d<DD>
Delete pattern space.
Start next cycle.
<DT>D<DD>
Delete up to the first embedded newline in the pattern space.
Start next cycle, but skip reading from the input
if there is still data in the pattern space.
<DT>h H<DD>
Copy/append pattern space to hold space.
<DT>g G<DD>
Copy/append hold space to pattern space.
<DT>x<DD>
Exchange the contents of the hold and pattern spaces.
<DT>l<DD>
List out the current line in a ``visually unambiguous'' form.
<DT>n N<DD>
Read/append the next line of input into the pattern space.
<DT>p<DD>
Print the current pattern space.
<DT>P<DD>
Print up to the first embedded newline of the current pattern space.
<DT>s/<I>regexp</I>/<I>replacement</I>/

<DD>
Attempt to match
<I>regexp</I>

against the pattern space.
If successful, replace that portion matched
with
<I>replacement</I>.

The
<I>replacement</I>

may contain the special character
<B>&amp;</B>

to refer to that portion of the pattern space which matched,
and the special escapes \1 through \9 to refer to the
corresponding matching sub-expressions in the
<I>regexp</I>.

<DT>w<DD>
<I>filename</I>

Write the current pattern space to
<I>filename</I>.

<DT>y/<I>source</I>/<I>dest</I>/

<DD>
Transliterate the characters in the pattern space which appear in
<I>source</I>

to the corresponding character in
<I>dest</I>.

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Addresses</H2>

<I>Sed</I> commands can be given with no addresses, in which
case the command will be executed for all input lines;
with one address, in which case the command will only be executed
for input lines which match that address; or with two
addresses, in which case the command will be executed
for all input lines which match the inclusive range of
lines starting from the first address and continuing to
the second address.
Three things to note about address ranges:
the syntax is
<I>addr1</I>,<I>addr2</I>

(i.e., the addresses are separated by a comma);
the line which
<I>addr1</I>

matched will always be accepted,
even if
<I>addr2</I>

selects an earlier line;
and if
<I>addr2</I>

is a
<I>regexp</I>,

it will not be tested against the line that
<I>addr1</I>

matched.
<P>

After the address (or address-range),
and before the command, a
<B>!</B>

may be inserted,
which specifies that the command shall only be
executed if the address (or address-range) does
<B>not</B>

match.
<P>

The following address types are supported:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>number</I>

<DD>
Match only the specified line
<I>number</I>.

<DT><I>first</I>~<I>step</I>

<DD>
Match every
<I>step</I>'th

line starting with line
<I>first</I>.

For example, ``sed -n 1~2p'' will print all the odd-numbered lines in
the input stream, and the address 2~5 will match every fifth line,
starting with the second.
(This is a GNU extension.)
<DT>$<DD>
Match the last line.
<DT>/<I>regexp</I>/

<DD>
Match lines matching the regular expression
<I>regexp</I>.

<DT><B></B>\c<I>regexp</I><B>c</B>

<DD>
Match lines matching the regular expression
<I>regexp</I>.

The
<B>c</B>

may be any character.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Regular expressions</H2>

POSIX.2 BREs
<I>should</I>

be supported, but they aren't completely yet.
The
<B>\n</B>

sequence in a regular expression matches the newline character.
There are also some GNU extensions.
[XXX FIXME: more needs to be said.
At the very least, a reference to another document which
describes what is supported should be given.]
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Miscellaneous notes</H2>

This version of sed supports a
\<B>&lt;newline&gt;</B>

sequence in
all regular expressions, the
<I>replacement</I>

part of a substitute (s) command, and in the
<I>source</I>

and
<I>dest</I>

parts of a transliterate (y) command.
The \ is stripped, and the newline is kept.
