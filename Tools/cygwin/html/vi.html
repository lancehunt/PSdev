<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>Vim</B>

is a text editor that is upwards compatible to Vi.
It can be used to edit any ASCII text.
It is especially useful for editing
programs.
<P>

There are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo,
multi windows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line
editing, filename completion, on-line help, visual selection, etc..
See &quot;:help vi_diff.txt&quot; for a summary of the differences between
<B>Vim</B>

and Vi.
<P>

While running
<B>Vim</B>

a lot of help can be obtained from the on-line help system, with the &quot;:help&quot;
command.
See the ON-LINE HELP section below.
<P>

Most often
<B>Vim</B>

is started to edit a single file with the command
<P>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>vim file<BR>
<P>

More generally
<B>Vim</B>

is started with:
<P>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>vim [options] [filelist]<BR>
<P>

If the filelist is missing, the editor will start with an empty buffer.
Otherwise exactly one out of the following four may be used to choose one or
more files to be edited.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>file ..<DD>
A list of filenames.
The first one will be the current file and read into the buffer.
The cursor will be positioned on the first line of the buffer.
You can get to the other files with the &quot;:next&quot; command.
To edit a file that starts with a dash, precede the filelist with &quot;--&quot;.
<DT>-<DD>
The file to edit is read from stdin.  Commands are read from stderr, which
should be a tty.
<DT>-t {tag}<DD>
The file to edit and the initial cursor position depends on a &quot;tag&quot;, a sort
of goto label.
{tag} is looked up in the tags file, the associated file becomes the current
file and the associated command is executed.
Mostly this is used for C programs, in which case {tag} could be a function
name.
The effect is that the file containing that function becomes the current file
and the cursor is positioned on the start of the function.
See &quot;:help tag-commands&quot;.
<DT>-q [errorfile]<DD>
Start in quickFix mode.
The file [errorfile] is read and the first error is displayed.
If [errorfile] is omitted, the filename is obtained from the 'errorfile'
option (defaults to &quot;AztecC.Err&quot; for the Amiga, &quot;errors.vim&quot; on other
systems).
Further errors can be jumped to with the &quot;:cn&quot; command.
See &quot;:help quickfix&quot;.
</DL>
<P>

<B>Vim</B>

behaves differently, depending on the name of the command (the executable may
still be the same file).
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>vim<DD>
The &quot;normal&quot; way, everything is default.
<DT>ex<DD>
Start in Ex mode.
Go to Normal mode with the &quot;:vi&quot; command.
Can also be done with the &quot;-e&quot; argument.
<DT>view<DD>
Start in read-only mode.  You will be protected from writing the files.  Can
also be done with the &quot;-R&quot; argument.
<DT>gvim gview<DD>
The GUI version.
Starts a new window.
Can also be done with the &quot;-g&quot; argument.
<DT>rvim rview rgvim rgview<DD>
Like the above, but with restrictions.  It will not be possible to start shell
commands, or suspend
<B>Vim.</B>

Can also be done with the &quot;-Z&quot; argument.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

The options may be given in any order, before or after filenames.
Options without an argument can be combined after a single dash.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>+[num]<DD>
For the first file the cursor will be positioned on line &quot;num&quot;.
If &quot;num&quot; is missing, the cursor will be positioned on the last line.
<DT>+/{pat}<DD>
For the first file the cursor will be positioned on the
first occurrence of {pat}.
See &quot;:help search-pattern&quot; for the available search patterns.
<DT>+{command}<DD>
<DT>-c {command}<DD>
{command} will be executed after the
first file has been read.
{command} is interpreted as an Ex command.
If the {command} contains spaces it must be enclosed in double quotes (this
depends on the shell that is used).
Example: Vim &quot;+set si&quot; main.c
<BR>

Note: You can use up to 10 &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-c&quot; commands.
<DT>-b<DD>
Binary mode.
A few options will be set that makes it possible to edit a binary or
executable file.
<DT>-C<DD>
Compatible.  Set the 'compatible' option.
This will make
<B>Vim</B>

behave mostly like Vi, even though a .vimrc file exists.
<DT>-d {device}<DD>
Open {device} for use as a terminal.
Only on the Amiga.
Example:
&quot;-d con:20/30/600/150&quot;.
<DT>-e<DD>
Start
<B>Vim</B>

in Ex mode, just like the executable was called &quot;ex&quot;.
<DT>-f<DD>
Foreground.  For the GUI version,
<B>Vim</B>

will not fork and detach from the shell it was started in.
On the Amiga,
<B>Vim</B>

is not restarted to open a new window.
This option should be used when
<B>Vim</B>

is executed by a program that will wait for the edit
session to finish (e.g. mail).
On the Amiga the &quot;:sh&quot; and &quot;:!&quot; commands will not work.
<DT>-F<DD>
If
<B>Vim</B>

has been compiled with FKMAP support for editing right-to-left
oriented files and Farsi keyboard mapping, this option starts
<B>Vim</B>

in Farsi mode, i.e. 'fkmap' and 'rightleft' are set.
Otherwise an error message is given and
<B>Vim</B>

aborts.
<DT>-g<DD>
If
<B>Vim</B>

has been compiled with GUI support, this option enables the GUI.
If no GUI support was compiled in, an error message is given and
<B>Vim</B>

aborts.
<DT>-h<DD>
Give a bit of help about the command line arguments and options.
After this
<B>Vim</B>

exits.
<DT>-H<DD>
If
<B>Vim</B>

has been compiled with RIGHTLEFT support for editing right-to-left
oriented files and Hebrew keyboard mapping, this option starts
<B>Vim</B>

in Hebrew mode, i.e. 'hkmap' and 'rightleft' are set.
Otherwise an error message is given and
<B>Vim</B>

aborts.
<DT>-i {viminfo}<DD>
When using the viminfo file is enabled, this option sets the filename to use,
instead of the default &quot;~/.viminfo&quot;.
This can also be used to skip the use of the .viminfo file, by giving the name
&quot;NONE&quot;.
<DT>-L<DD>
Same as -r.
<DT>-l<DD>
Lisp mode.
Sets the 'lisp' and 'showmatch' options on.
<DT>-m<DD>
Modifying files is disabled.
Resets the 'write' option, so that writing files is not possible.
<DT>-N<DD>
No-compatible mode.  Reset the 'compatible' option.
This will make
<B>Vim</B>

behave a bit better, but less Vi compatible, even though a .vimrc file does
not exist.
<DT>-n<DD>
No swap file will be used.
Recovery after a crash will be impossible.
Handy if you want to edit a file on a very slow medium (e.g. floppy).
Can also be done with &quot;:set uc=0&quot;.
Can be undone with &quot;:set uc=200&quot;.
<DT>-o[N]<DD>
Open N windows.
When N is omitted, open one window for each file.
<DT>-R<DD>
Read-only mode.
The 'readonly' option will be set.
You can still edit the buffer, but will be prevented from accidently
overwriting a file.
If you do want to overwrite a file, add an exclamation mark to the Ex command,
as in &quot;:w!&quot;.
The -R option also implies the -n option (see below).
The 'readonly' option can be reset with &quot;:set noro&quot;.
See &quot;:help 'readonly'&quot;.
<DT>-r<DD>
List swap files, with information about using them for recovery.
<DT>-r {file}<DD>
Recovery mode.
The swap file is used to recover a crashed editing session.
The swap file is a file with the same filename as the text file with &quot;.swp&quot;
appended.
See &quot;:help recovery&quot;.
<DT>-s<DD>
Silent mode.  Only when started as &quot;Ex&quot; or when the &quot;-e&quot; option was given
before the &quot;-s&quot; option.
<DT>-s {scriptin}<DD>
The script file {scriptin} is read.
The characters in the file are interpreted as if you had typed them.
The same can be done with the command &quot;:source! {scriptin}&quot;.
If the end of the file is reached before the editor exits, further characters
are read from the keyboard.
<DT>-T {terminal}<DD>
Tells
<B>Vim</B>

the name of the terminal you are using.
Only required when the automatic way doesn't work.
Should be a terminal known
to
<B>Vim</B>

(builtin) or defined in the termcap or terminfo file.
<DT>-u {vimrc}<DD>
Use the commands in the file {vimrc} for initializations.
All the other initializations are skipped.
Use this to edit a special kind of files.
It can also be used to skip all initializations by giving the name &quot;NONE&quot;.
See &quot;:help initialization&quot; within vim for more details.
<DT>-U {gvimrc}<DD>
Use the commands in the file {gvimrc} for GUI initializations.
All the other GUI initializations are skipped.
It can also be used to skip all GUI initializations by giving the name &quot;NONE&quot;.
See &quot;:help gui-init&quot; within vim for more details.
<DT>-V<DD>
Verbose.  Give messages about which files are sourced and for reading and
writing a viminfo file.
<DT>-v<DD>
Start
<B>Vim</B>

in Vi mode, just like the executable was called &quot;vi&quot;.  This only has effect
when the executable is called &quot;ex&quot;.
<DT>-w {scriptout}<DD>
All the characters that you type are recorded in the file
{scriptout}, until you exit
<B>Vim.</B>

This is useful if you want to create a script file to be used with &quot;vim -s&quot; or
&quot;:source!&quot;.
If the {scriptout} file exists, characters are appended.
<DT>-W {scriptout}<DD>
Like -w, but an existing file is overwritten.
<DT>-x<DD>
Filter read and written files through crypt.  Not implemented yet.
<DT>-Z<DD>
Restricted mode.  Works like the executable starts with &quot;r&quot;.
<DT>--<DD>
Denotes the end of the options.
Arguments after this will be handled as a file name.
This can be used to edit a filename that starts with a '-'.

Most of
<B>Vim</B>

was made by Bram Moolenaar, with a lot of help from others.
See &quot;:help credits&quot;.
<BR>

<B>Vim</B>

is based on Stevie, worked on by: Tim Thompson,
Tony Andrews and G.R. (Fred) Walter.
Although hardly any of the original code remains.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

Probably.
See &quot;:help todo&quot; for a list of known problems.
<P>

Note that a number of things that may be regarded as bugs by some, are in fact
caused by a too-faithful reproduction of Vi's behaviour.
And if you think other things are bugs &quot;because Vi does it differently&quot;,
you should take a closer look at the vi_diff.txt file (or type :help
vi_diff.txt when in Vim).
Also have a look at the 'compatible' and 'cpoptions' options.
