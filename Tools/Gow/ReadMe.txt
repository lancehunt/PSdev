ABOUT
-----

Gow (Gnu On Windows) is the lightweight alternative to Cygwin. It uses a 
convenient Windows installer that installs about 130 extremely useful 
open source UNIX applications compiled as native win32 binaries. It is 
designed to be as small as possible, about 10 MB, as opposed to Cygwin 
which can run well over 100 MB depending upon options.

FEATURES & BENEFITS
-------------------

* Ultra light: Small, light subset (about 10 MB) of of very useful UNIX 
  binaries that do not have decent installers.
* Shell window from any directory: Adds a Windows Explorer shell window 
  so that you can right-click on any directory and open a command 
  (cmd.exe) window from that directory.
* Simple install/remove: Easy to install and remove, all files contained 
  in a single directory in a standard C:\Program Files path.
* Included in PATH: All binaries are conveniently installed into the 
  Windows PATH so they are accessible from a command-line window.
* Stable binaries: All commands are kept up to date but also as stable as 
  possible.
